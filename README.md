# Machine-Learning-Web-Application
🧠 Machine Learning Web Application – Weka-Inspired (Modern UI)
This project is a web-based Machine Learning application inspired by the Weka Explorer software, redesigned with a modern, clean, and compact user interface.
The application provides an end-to-end workflow for both supervised and unsupervised learning, allowing users to preprocess data, train models, evaluate performance, and visualize results — all within a grid-based, tab-oriented interface without unnecessary scrolling.
The goal of this project is to combine the clarity and structure of Weka with a modern web design, making it suitable for academic projects, practical labs (TP), and demonstrations.
✨ Features
🔹 User Interface
Weka-inspired layout with tabs and panels
No global vertical scrolling
Compact grid-based organization
Modern, professional color palette
Scrollbars only inside panels when needed
🔹 Supervised Learning (Classification)
Dataset loading and preprocessing (e.g., Diabetes dataset)
Train/Test split (80% / 20%)
k-NN classifier
k values from 1 to 10
Confusion matrix (TP, TN, FP, FN)
Precision, Recall, F-measure
Precision vs k visualization
Automatic detection of the best k
Naive Bayes
C4.5 Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
🔹 Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
K-Means clustering
